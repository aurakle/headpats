# Headpat a Friend!

Ever been in a situation where you wanted to take your arm, 
put it on a little goober's head, and rub it back and forth in a sign of affection?
Well, now you can!
This mod lets you headpat other players by holding right-click on their head.
Cute critters of all shapes and sizes rejoice!

## Configuration

This mod can make use of [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) 
and [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) to let you modify its config ingame.
A few small tweaks can be made based on preference:

- First-person sway strength
- Petted players make purr sounds
